# Extra packs

For the *DbToolsBundle*, we chose to have a decentralized approach. The bundle comes with
a pack of anonymizers but we don't want to see this list growing to much.

That's why we added possibility to create and include **extra packs of anonymizers**.

If you can't find what you need with anonymizers provided by the core,
you may find it with them. And if you can't find it with them either, then it's may be
time to [create your own ones](./custom-anonymizers),
and may be to [share them with the community](../contribute/pack)!

Here is a list of official packs:

* [Pack fr-FR](https://github.com/DbToolsBundle/pack-fr-fr) => `composer require dbtoolsbundle/pack-fr-fr`

:::tip
These packs can be provided by the DbToolsbundle team or by the community.
[Look for more of them on github](https://github.com/topics/db-tools-bundle-pack).
